## email_maker.py
To use this tool simply provide the name of the application, the path to your first names, the path to your last names and what the domain you want to use at the end of the email address.

Example:
python3 email_maker.py /home/user/Documents/firstnames.txt /home/user/Documents/lastnames.txt google.com

Of course, if you are running email_maker.py fromt the same location as your text files then there is no need for the full path.
